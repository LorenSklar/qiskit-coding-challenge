#0 Getting Started
Install Qiskit. Qiskit is an open source quantum computing framework for the IBM quantum computing stack. More information at qiskit.org.

#01 Quantum Coin Flip
Implement a quantum coin flip. A quantum coin flip returns a single bit with value “0” 50% of the time and “1” 50% of the time.

#02 Quantum Cards
Implement a quantum deck of cards that allows you to shuffle and deal. Just as with a real deck, shuffle returns a deck of cards in random order, and deal returns a single card and the remaining deck with that card removed. For example, after a shuffle, deal returns a 7♠️. The probability of dealing another 7♠️ from the remaining deck is zero.
